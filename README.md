## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries


### What I learned
## In this project,
 I learned and applied several CSS techniques to create a unique design and position elements in specific ways.
- Single background with background-image and background-color
To create a single background, I used the CSS properties background-image and background-color. I set a background image with background-image and a background color with background-color. This allowed me to create a custom background with an image and color that complement each other.

- Side-by-side positioning with float
To position an image and text side-by-side, I used the CSS property float. I applied float: left to the image to float it to the left, and float: right to the text to float it to the right. This created the effect of the two elements being positioned side-by-side.

- Stop Floating with Clear
To stop the footer icons from floating and make them appear below the floated elements, I used the CSS clear property. I applied clear: both to the footer icons, which forced them to appear below the previous floated elements, preventing them from floating themselves.

## I learned a lot about RWD,
- firstly the 'mobile first' principle, some techniques like media queries which are used to apply specific CSS styles depending on the screen size.
I learned 3 things about media queries:

- Adapting layouts: Media queries allow you to change the layout of elements based on the screen size. For example, you can switch from a multi-column layout on a large screen to a single-column layout on mobile.

- Changing styles: These can be used to adjust properties like font size, background color, or even hide certain elements on smaller screens.

- Breakpoints: Media queries use "breakpoints" to define at which screen sizes the styles should change. Standard sizes include 480px for mobile and 768px for tablets.


### Continued development

I will continue to learn flexbox and grid to properly manage RWD


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.michaelkentburns.com) - This site helped me step by step to build my web page, with its advice, guidelines, and mentoring.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3school.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand how works Responsive Web Design. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
